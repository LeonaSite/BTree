    		<h2>July 4, 1946</h2>
    		<p>Following the Philippines' independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, the Bureau underwent a separate re-establishment. A significant reorganization took place on October 1, 1947, through Executive Order No. 94. This order led to the merging of the Accounting Unit and the Revenue Accounts and Statistical Division, the consolidation of records in the Administrative Division's Records Section, and the centralization of all legal work in the Law Division. Simultaneously, Revenue Regulations No. V-2, dated October 23, 1947, structured the country into 31 inspection units, each headed by a Provincial Revenue Agent.
</br></br>
The second major reorganization unfolded on January 1, 1951, with Executive Order No. 392. This executive order established three new departments within the Bureau: Legal, Assessment, and Collection. In the same month, the Withholding Tax Unit was instituted under the Income Tax Division following the adoption of the withholding tax system through Republic Act (RA) 690.
</br></br>
The third significant reorganization occurred on March 1, 1954, via Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 41. This resulted in the establishment of key offices, including the Specific Tax Division, Litigation Section, Processing Section, and the Office of the City Revenue Examiner. In September 1954, a Training Unit was created.
</br></br>
As a step toward decentralization, the Bureau established its first two Regional Offices in Cebu and Davao on July 20, 1955, through RMO No. V-536. Each Regional Office, led by a Regional Director, was supported by chiefs for branches such as Tax Audit, Collection, Investigation, Legal, and Administrative. This marked the division of the Philippines into three revenue regions.
</br></br>
The organizational expansion continued in 1956, with the Bureau's Regional Offices increasing to eight and later to ten in 1957. The Accounting Machine Branch was created in each Regional Office.
</br></br>
In January 1957, the title of the head of the Bureau changed from Collector to Commissioner, with Jose Aranas serving as the last Collector and the first Commissioner of the BIR.
</br></br>
A significant development in 1958 was the establishment of the Tax Census Division and corresponding Tax Census Units for each Regional Office. This aimed to consolidate statements of assets, incomes, and liabilities into a National Tax Census.
</br></br>
To fortify tax payment enforcement and discourage tax evasion, the Rewards Law (RA No. 233) was enacted on June 19, 1959. This law offered informers a 25% reward equivalent to the revenue collected from tax evaders.
</br></br>
In 1964, the Philippines was re-divided into 15 regions and 72 inspection districts, and the Tobacco Inspection Board and Accountable Forms Committee were created under the Office of the Commissioner.

    		<h2>Ferdinand Marcos Admiristration</h2>
    		<p>A.	Ferdinand Marcos's administration in the Philippines (1965-1986), there were various tax policies implemented. Initially, his regime introduced reforms aiming to centralize tax collection and modernize tax administration. However, it was also criticized for alleged corruption, tax evasion, and a lack of transparency in tax collection processes. Marcos's era witnessed changes in tax laws, though the effectiveness and fairness of these changes remain a topic of debate among historians and economists. The tax system under the Marcos administration was generally regressive as it was heavily dependent on indirect taxes. Indirect taxes and international trade taxes accounted for about 35% of total tax revenue, while direct taxes only accounted for 25%. Government expenditure for economic services peaked during this period, focusing mainly on infrastructure development, with about 33% of the budget spent on capital outlays. In response to the higher global interest rates and to the depreciation of the peso, the government became increasingly reliant on domestic financing to finance fiscal deficit. The government also started liberalizing tariff policy during this period by enacting the initial Tariff Reform Program, which narrowed the tariff structure from a range of 100%–0% to 50%–10%, and the Import Liberalization Program, which aimed at reducing or eliminating tariffs and realigning indirect taxes.
</br></br>
B.	Executive Order No. 206 was issued in the Philippines during the Marcos administration on January 9, 1970. This order restructured the internal revenue taxes, particularly introducing changes to the tax rates, exemptions, and other provisions. It aimed to reform the tax system to generate revenue for the government and support socioeconomic programs. Whereas, there is an imperative need for a more effective system of collecting national internal revenue taxes as a means of increasing tax collections and protecting the revenues. The President of the Philippines, utilizing his legal authority, instructs the Central Bank of the Philippines to accept payments of specific national internal revenue taxes. These include income taxes (inclusive of wage withholding taxes), estate, inheritance, and gift taxes, as well as certain percentage taxes, excluding those stemming from imports. Additionally, the directive encompasses taxes related to banks, insurance companies, franchise taxes, and amusement taxes.
</br></br>
C.	The National Internal Revenue Code of 1977, enacted during Ferdinand Marcos's presidency in the Philippines on June 3, 1997. It aimed to consolidate and modernize tax laws. It encompassed changes in income tax, estate tax, donor's tax, VAT, and other related taxes. Key features included revised rates, expanded taxable items, and the introduction of the VAT system, aiming to streamline administration and bolster revenue collection. However, assessments varied, with critics highlighting potential loopholes and enforcement challenges. The code underwent amendments over time to address evolving economic conditions and perceived shortcomings in the tax system. It acknowledges the evolution of tax laws since 1939, the obsolescence of certain provisions, and the need for a unified and comprehensive tax code. The President of the Philippines, ordered the consolidation of all internal revenue laws into this new code to streamline tax regulations for efficient administration and guidance of taxpayers. The code's effectivity was immediate, while respecting the effective dates of prior amendments and new revenue laws consolidated into it. In addition, The National Internal Revenue Code of 1977 is a comprehensive law in the Philippines that outlines the country's tax regulations, covering various types of taxes, procedures, exemptions, and penalties. It provides guidelines for income taxes, value-added taxes, estate taxes, and other levies, shaping the structure and implementation of taxation in the country.

The Ministry of Finance's specific powers and functions are listed in the document. These include developing and implementing tax policies, collecting government revenues, managing national funds, negotiating, and servicing debts, overseeing the policies and plans of government-affiliated financial institutions, and making sure local revenue administration policies and measures are carried out.</br></br>

Tax Reform Program TRP 1986
1986 Tax Reform Program: Following the EDSA uprising, the Aquino Administration passed this tax reform program. The program's objective was to improve the nation's feeble tax structure by boosting economic growth through positive revenue contributions.
During the first Aquino administration, the Philippines implemented the 1986 Tax Reform Program (TRP). Through the correction of existing taxes that hindered business incentives, the initiative attempted to create horizontal equity, simplify the tax code, increase revenue responsiveness to economic activity, and stimulate growth.
Since the beginning of the new system following the EDSA revolution, the intention to "simplify" taxes has existed. The TRP was created to bolster the nation's feeble tax structure by boosting economic growth through positive revenue contributions. 
The TRP was mostly concerned with government spending on infrastructure development and economic services as well as indirect tax collection. Despite inheriting a significant budgetary deficit from the previous administration, the first Aquino administration was able to boost tax collection and minimize fiscal imbalance by enacting the 1986 Tax Reform Program and the value-added tax.</br></br>

Memorandum Order No. 175, May 23, 1988

    		<h2>Fidel Ramos Administration</h2>
    		<p>
The year 1993 marked a pivotal moment in the history of the Bureau with the appointment of its first lady Commissioner, Liwayway Vinzons-Chato. Her tenure ushered in a period of significant transformation aimed at realizing the Bureau's vision and mission. At the heart of this transformative journey was the initiation of a comprehensive and integrated program known as the Action-Centered Transformation Program (ACTS). This ambitious program was designed to strategically realign and guide the entire organization toward the fulfillment of its overarching goals.</br></br>

Commissioner Chato's visionary leadership was particularly evident in the year 1994 when the Bureau embarked on a landmark initiative—the five-year Tax Computerization Project (TCP). This ambitious undertaking sought to revolutionize the Bureau's operations through the establishment of a modern and computerized Integrated Tax System and Internal Administration System. The introduction of advanced technological solutions aimed to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and overall effectiveness in tax administration.</br></br>

Building on the momentum of the Tax Computerization Project, additional measures were introduced in July 1997 to further streamline the operations of the Bureau. Executive Order No. 430 played a pivotal role in supporting the implementation of the computerized Integrated Tax System. The order brought about notable changes, including the creation of a fourth Revenue Group within the BIR. This newly established Legal and Enforcement Group, headed by a Deputy Commissioner, played a crucial role in fortifying the legal and enforcement aspects of the Bureau's functions.</br></br>

Executive Order No. 430 also marked the establishment of several key services within the Bureau. The Internal Affairs Service was created to oversee internal matters and ensure compliance with regulations. Simultaneously, the Taxpayers Assistance Service was introduced to enhance support for taxpayers navigating the intricacies of the tax system. The Information Planning and Quality Service emerged as a vital component, focusing on information management and service quality improvement. Additionally, the creation of Revenue Data Centers contributed to the Bureau's capacity for data-driven decision-making and overall operational efficiency.</br></br></br></br>

    		<h2>Joseph Estrada Administration</h2>
    		<p>FE.O No. 127, January 30, 1987
As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Joseph Estrada served as the 13th President of the Philippines from 1998 to 2001. During his administration, there were several economic and fiscal policies implemented, including taxation measures. However, the specific details of tax policies during the Estrada administration may require referencing historical records or official government documents.</br></br>

During his term, the Philippines experienced both economic growth and challenges. It's important to note that taxation policies are usually subject to changes and amendments over time, and different administrations may introduce various reforms.</br></br>

To gather detailed and accurate information on the taxation policies of the Estrada administration, you may want to refer to official government records, archives, or academic sources that cover Philippine economic history during that period. Additionally, official publications, economic reports, and the records of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) may provide insights into the specific tax measures and changes implemented during his presidency.</br></br>

What is Estrada Administration? 
The Estrada administration widened the coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) to the landless peasants in the country side, distributing more than 266,000 hectares (660,000 acres) of land to 175,000 landless farmers, including land owned by the traditional rural elite.</br></br>

With the advent of President Estrada's administration, a Deputy Commissioner of the BIR, Beethoven Rualo, was appointed as Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Under his leadership, priority reform measures were undertaken to enhance voluntary compliance and improve the Bureau's productivity. </br></br>

One of the most significant reform measures was the implementation of the Economic Recovery Assistance Payment (ERAP) Program, which granted immunity from audit and investigation to taxpayers who have paid 20% more than the tax paid in 1997 for income tax, VAT and/or percentage taxes.</br></br>

In order to encourage and educate consumers/taxpayers to demand sales invoices and receipts, the raffle promo "Humingi ng Resibo, Manalo ng Libo-Libo" was institutionalized in 1999. The Large Taxpayers Monitoring System was also established under Commissioner Rualo's administration to closely monitor the tax compliance of the country's large taxpayers.</br></br>

The coming of the new millennium ushered in the changing of the guard in the BIR with the appointment of Dakila Fonacier as the new Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Under his administration, measures that would enhance taxpayer compliance and deter tax violations were prioritized. </br></br>

The most significant of these measures include: full utilization of tax computerization in the Bureau's operations; expansion of the use of
electronic Documentary Stamp Tax metering machine and establishment of tie-up with the national government agencies and local government units for the prompt remittance of withholding taxes; and implementation of Compromise Settlement Program for taxpayers with outstanding accounts receivable and disputed assessments with the BIR.</br></br>

What is the general idea of EO 175?
The rules and regulations shall provide for, among others, the banning, recalling or withdrawing from the market drugs and devices which are not registered, unsafe, inefficacious or of doubtful therapeutic value, the adoption of an official National Drug Formulary, and the use of generic names in the labeling of drugs.</br></br>

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have specific information on Executive Order (EO) 175. Executive Orders are legal orders issued by the President of a country to manage the operations of the federal government. In the Philippines, Executive Orders are often used by the President to implement laws or policies.</br></br>

To obtain the latest and most accurate information about Executive Order 175, I recommend checking official government sources such as the Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines or the website of the Office of the President. These sources should have the full text and details of the executive order, including its purpose, provisions, and any amendments.</br></br>

You can also check with the relevant government agencies or legal databases for any updates or analyses related to Executive Order 175. If this executive order was issued after my last update in January 2022, it's essential to consult the most recent and authoritative sources for the latest information.</br></br>

Executive Order No. 306, signed by President Joseph Ejercito Estrada on October 31, 2000, focused on further streamlining the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in the Philippines to improve administrative control over certain categories of taxpayers and enhance the effectiveness of its computerized integrated tax system. Here's a summary of the key provisions:</br></br>

   - The Excise Taxpayers Service, previously part of the Operations Group, was abolished, and its functions were integrated with the Large Taxpayers Service.</br></br>

5. Repealing Clauses:
   - All existing rules and regulations or parts thereof inconsistent with the provisions of Executive Order No. 306 were revoked.</br></br>

6. Effectivity:
   - The executive order took effect immediately upon its issuance on October 31, 2000.</br></br>

This executive order reflects the government's effort to make the BIR more efficient and responsive in its role as a revenue-collecting agency, particularly in the context of economic challenges during the Asian financial crisis.</br></br>

Integrated Tax System (ITS)</br></br>
The core of the BIR TCP is the Integrated Tax System or ITS. ITS is a set of related systems and processes, which run and facilitate the Bureau's core business functions. It provides maximum automation and minimum manual intervention in BIR operations.</br></br>

What is the meaning of tax integration?</br></br>
Tax Integrating is a concept that looks to removing the differences in tax payable because of a choice in business or income earning structure. There are many of these in the Income Tax Act.</br></br></br></br>

    		<p>

Electronic Filing and Payment System (eFPS)</br></br>
After the historic EDSA II events in January 2001, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who had just taken office, named Atty. The new Commissioner of Internal Revenue is René G. Bañez.
The BIR's main goal during Commissioner Bañez's leadership was to change the organization and put the needs of the taxpayer first. This was accomplished by putting into practice change initiatives aimed at: 1) simplifying and adapting the tax system to Philippine culture; 2) streamlining and streamlining tax processes; 3) restructuring the Bureau of Internal Revenue to provide it with more financial and administrative flexibility; and 4) revamping human resource policies, systems, and procedures to change the workforce and make it more responsive to taxpayers' needs.
A number of initiatives were also put in place to improve the Bureau's ability to generate income; the most prominent ones being the extension of the creditable withholding tax system's coverage and the introduction of the voluntary assessment and compromise settlement programs. Through the Electronic Filing and Payment approach (eFPS), a technology-based approach that encourages the paperless filing of tax returns and payment of taxes was also adopted.
Following Commissioner Bañez's departure on August 19, 2002, Undersecretary of Finance Cornelio C. Gison was named the acting BIR Commissioner. Eight days later, on August 27, 2002, Guillermo L. Parayno, Jr., a former commissioner of customs, was named the next Internal Revenue Commissioner (CIR).
Abatement Program (VAAP)
Commissioner Parayno made the Voluntary Assessment and Abatement Program (VAAP) available to taxpayers who had underreported sales, receipts, or income, barely one month after taking on his new role as CIR. Commissioner Parayno implemented the use of new systems, like the electronic broadcasting system to improve the security of tax payments and the Reconciliation of Listings for Enforcement, or RELIEF System, to detect under-declarations of taxable income by taxpayers, in order to improve the BIR's performance in collecting revenue. The BIR also increased the scope of its electronic services during Commissioner Parayno's leadership, adding web-based TIN application and processing, electronic invoice and receipt raffles, e-payment gateways, e-substituted tax return filing, and electronic sales report submission.
</br></br>
Reconciliation of Listings for Enforcement or RELIEF 
</br></br>
The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is revamping its work processes to increase revenue collections and improve audit quality by utilizing internal and external information resources. To enhance its assessment functions, the BIR has identified information technology as an effective tool to improve tax administration. The Reconciliation of Listings for Enforcement (RELIEF) System was developed to support the third-party information program and voluntary assessment program of the Bureau. The RELIEF System cross-references third-party information from taxpayers' Summary Lists of Sales and Purchases, which are required to be submitted quarterly under Revenue Regulations Nos. 7-95, as amended by RR 13-97, RR 7-99, and RR 8-2002.
The RELIEF System covers all VAT taxpayers above threshold limits set by RR 8-2002, who are required to submit Summary Lists of Sales and Purchases in magnetic form based on a prescribed electronic format. The system consolidates and matches information with other externally sourced data to detect under-declaration of revenues/over-declaration of cost and expenses, resulting in greater tax potential. In summary, the BIR is using the RELIEF System to improve tax administration and increase revenue collections by leveraging information technology to enhance its assessment functions and cross-reference third-party information from taxpayers' Summary Lists of Sales and Purchases.
</br></br>
Run After Tax Evaders (RATE)
</br></br>
The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) is responsible for investigating criminal violations of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, and supporting the prosecution of cases that will increase voluntary compliance, foster public confidence in the tax system, and have the greatest deterrent effect, in accordance with the Run Against Tax Evaders (RATE) Program. The BIR has developed the Reconciliation of Listings for Enforcement (RELIEF) System to support the third-party information program and voluntary assessment program of the Bureau. The RELIEF System cross-references third-party information from taxpayers' Summary Lists of Sales and Purchases, which are required to be submitted quarterly under Revenue Regulations Nos. 7-95, as amended by RR 13-97, RR 7-99, and RR 8-2002. The RELIEF System covers all VAT taxpayers above threshold limits set by RR 8-2002, who are required to submit Summary Lists of Sales and Purchases in magnetic form based on a prescribed electronic format. The system consolidates and matches information with other externally sourced data to detect under-declaration of revenues/over-declaration of cost and expenses, resulting in greater tax potential. The Run After Tax Evaders (RATE) Program is an enforcement program of the BIR that aims to generate a maximum deterrent effect on the taxpaying public by highlighting that tax evasion is a crime and violators will be caught and punished. The RATE Program seeks to identify and prosecute high-profile tax evaders, generating the maximum deterrent effect by impressing on the public that tax evasion is a crime and violators will be caught and punished.
</br></br>
Nationwide Rollout of Computerized Systems (NRCS) and National Program Support for Tax Administration Reform (NPSTAR)
</br></br>
In order to expand the use of the Bureau's Integrated Tax System throughout its non-computerized Revenue District Offices, the Nationwide Rollout of Computerized Systems (NRCS) initiative was launched. To increase BIR efficiency in various areas of tax administration (i.e., taxpayer compliance, tax enforcement and control, etc.), several international development agencies funded the National Program Support for Tax Administration Reform (NPSTAR), which was introduced in 2007.
Commissioner Buñag resigned as the BIR's top official on June 29, 2007, and Lilian B. Hefti, the deputy commissioner for operations group, took over as the organization's second female commissioner. Commissioner Hefti concentrated on enhancing the application of business intelligence by starting a data matching project between the withholding agents' income payments and the recipients' reported income.

Local Government Units (LGUs)
</br></br>
LGUs, or Local Government Units, are divisions of a country that have the power to carry out specific government functions and duties within a designated area. The way LGUs are structured and operate can differ from country to country, but they typically include cities, municipalities, provinces, and other types of local governance. LGUs are essential in decentralizing governance and making decision-making more accessible to the public. They are responsible for providing local services, enforcing local policies, and managing local resources.

Computer-Assisted Audit Tools and Techniques (CAATTs)
</br></br>
CAATTs, or Computer-Assisted Audit Tools and Techniques, are software tools that auditors use to make their audit processes more efficient and effective. These tools are specifically designed to automate audit procedures, analyze large datasets, and provide auditors with valuable insights into an organization's financial and operational aspects. CAATTs can be utilized in a variety of audit areas, such as financial, operational, and compliance audits.

Project R.I.P (Rest in Peace)
</br></br>
Project RIP was introduced by the Bureau of Internal Revenue on February 9, 2010, with the aim of strengthening the evaluation process and optimizing the collection of estate taxes. The project seeks to enhance public awareness regarding the proper payment of estate taxes. Through Project RIP, the Bureau will closely monitor the proper payment of estate taxes, an area that has been historically overlooked by the BIR. Data from the National Statistics Office indicates a significant number of deaths in previous years, with a notable disparity in the filed estate tax returns as per BIR records. BIR Commissioner Joel L. Tan-Torres anticipates a collection of approximately P10.7 billion through this initiative.
The Revenue Memorandum Order No.10-2010 outlines the Bureau's strategies, including establishing partnerships with public and private institutions, engaging with decedents' families, and conducting a public awareness campaign on Project RIP. The Revenue District Office (RDO) is tasked with proactively monitoring potential estate tax cases by collaborating with various entities, such as civil registers, hospitals, and financial institutions. For tracking obituaries in newspapers, the National Investigation Division (NID) will compile a list of decedents, identifying "High Potential" cases with significant properties and potential tax payments. Coordination between the Deputy Commissioner for Information Systems Group and Operations Group will establish a Data Warehouse for potential estate tax cases, facilitating access for concerned BIR offices. The Deputy Commissioner for Legal and Enforcement Group will collaborate with the Operations Group to draft necessary issuances, policies, guidelines, and legal documents for the successful implementation of Project RIP.

    		<h2>Benigno Aquino III Administration</h2>
    		<p>The six-year term of former Philippine President Benigno S.C. Aquino III, spanning from 2010 to 2016. The period is characterized by economic growth and allegations of elitism. The administration's emphasis on good governance is acknowledged for fostering a conducive environment for investments. However, criticisms arise regarding perceived elitism and failures in public services and infrastructure development.
</br></br>
Key accomplishments of the Aquino administration include the passage of the Reproductive Health Bill, the implementation of the K-12 education system, and a favorable ruling in the South China Sea territorial dispute. Despite successes, challenges and controversies emerged, such as the Pork Barrel Scam, the SAF 44 incident, and the government's response to Super Typhoon Yolanda, which faced public scrutiny.
</br></br>
Legal issues, including the Corona impeachment trial and the signing of the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act, were notable events. The administration's fiscal achievements, marked by debt reduction and the Philippines' first-ever investment grade, are highlighted, as are key educational reforms like the K-12 system. The article also touches on health-related policies, including the controversial Dengvaxia vaccine program.
</br></br>
Transportation challenges, such as MRT derailments and traffic congestion, are discussed, along with the administration's infrastructure initiatives, including Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. The Aquino administration's success in reducing debt as a percentage of GDP is emphasized, contributing to its fiscal sustainability and earning positive credit ratings. The article concludes by underscoring both the achievements and challenges of the Aquino administration.

    		<h2>Rodirigo Duterte Administration</h2>
    		<p>The Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Law (TRAIN Law), officially designated as Republic Act No. 10963, is the initial package of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program (CTRP) signed into law by President Rodrigo Duterte on December 19, 2017.</br></br>

The TRAIN Act is aimed to generate revenue to achieve the 2022 and 2040 vision of the Duterte administration, namely, to eradicate extreme poverty, to create inclusive institutions that will offer equal opportunities to all, and to achieve higher income country status. Here are some key points about the TRAIN law:</br></br>

1.	Income Tax Reform:</br></br>
•	The law lowered personal income tax rates but expanded the tax base by removing certain exemptions.</br></br>
•	The tax brackets were adjusted, resulting in lower income tax rates for many taxpayers.</br></br>

2.	Value Added Tax (VAT) Exemptions:</br></br> 
•	Some goods and services were added to the list of VAT-exempt items, such as those related to senior citizens and persons with disabilities. </br></br>

3.	Excise Tax on Fuel:</br></br> 
•	The law implemented an excise tax on fuel, which was expected to have an impact on transportation costs and, consequently, the prices of goods and services. </br></br>

4.	Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Tax:</br></br> 
•	The TRAIN law imposed a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages to promote health and wellness. </br></br>

5.	Automobile Excise Tax:</br></br>
•	Excise taxes on automobiles were increased, particularly for luxury cars. </br></br>

6.	Social Mitigation Measures: </br></br>
•	The government introduced social mitigations measures to offset the potential impact of the tax reforms on the lower-income segments of the population. These included cash transfers and subsidies. </br></br>

7.	Infrastructure Spending: </br></br>
•	The additional revenue generated from the tax reforms was intended to fund the government's infrastructure projects under the "Build, Build, Build" program.</br></br>
